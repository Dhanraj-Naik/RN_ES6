### Scope 
- **Global Scope**
- **Local Scope** : can be divided into function scope and block scope.
  + **Function Scope** : Variable declared within the function
  + **Block Scope** : area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Whenever you see **{Curley brackets}** , it is a block scope.In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block. 
  *let* and *const* are block scope variables. *var* is globally scoped or function scoped.
